                    <p>
                        With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than
                        other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a
                        little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from
                        nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight);
                        males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of
                        nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in
                        their late teens and rarely live even a single century.

                        Elves
                    </h1>
                    <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and
                        members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from
                        well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only
                        100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only
                        marginally heavier than females.

                        Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of
                        copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of
                        liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant
                        clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>

                        Dwarves
                    </h1>
                    <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and
                        metal.
                        Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can
                        weigh
                        as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also
                        easily
                        a match for any of the larger folk.

                        Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common
                        shades
                        are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in
                        simple
                        styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male
                        dwarves
                        value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>

                        Half-Orcs
                    </h1>
                    <p>Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and
                        towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 5
                        and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.

                        Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other
                        scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc
                        who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of
                        pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans
                        might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.

                        Gnomes
                    </h1>
                    <p>A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body.
                        Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces
                        are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright
                        eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction,
                        as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around.

                        A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in
                        contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or
                        neat points. A gnome’s clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately
                        decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</p>

                        Halflings
                    </h1>
                    <p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or,
                        barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless
                        and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of
                        wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.

                        Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown
                        or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long
                        sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear
                        simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.

                        Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and
                        simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep
                        their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack
                        for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for
                        dithering.</p>
