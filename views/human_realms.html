                        The southernmost region, Eleron, is mostly infertile plains, but the further south
                        it goes there are thick jungles that contain many mysteries. The northern regions of
                        Eleron are ruled by King Augustus Sun, and his loyal advisors. The south is too wild
                        to tamed by the Eleronian Empire. The Sun Dynasty has ruled Eleron for three
                        centuries, and have outlasted all coup attempts throughout the centuries. They are a
                        strict culture that restricts magic heavily. Only approved magic may be learned
                        through schooling. They outright reject the Old Ways and its magic and punish those
                        who dare mutter any history or lore about such subjects. Most of the proletariat are
                        pacified and well-taken care of by the merchant class, who are skilled at what they
                        do. The ruling classes have cutthroat relationships, and it gets dirty sometimes.
                        The major cities are the capital Storm's End, Hearth of the Bay, Cape Ford, and
                        Sicilia.

                        The bleak tundra of Baern is the perfect descriptor for the culture that grows here.

                        religion, getting caught praying to the wrong gods, and that's the gulag for you.

                        Torwood, otherwise referred to as The Torwoods, is full of lush forest, rushing
                        rivers, and fertile land are home to the freest peoples of the four human kingdoms.
                        Their natural resources provide all the wealth this nation will need or has ever
                        needed. Led by a council of Dukes, this land has had a relatively peaceful
                        existence, but they lay claim to the lands of Durglagh and have had a rivalry with
                        the Eleronian Empire over the claims. There is history of in-fighting amongst the
                        nobles, but they usually end with limited bloodshed. However 100 years prior was the
                        Battle of Brothers, a bloody civil war that started on the first blossoms of {YEAR}
                        and lasted until the harsh winter, {The Long Dark}. The council's relationship with
                        the nation state of Baern is neutral. Torwood provides lumber, and other goods
                        (think of more) to Baern and Baern provides them with a variety of ore. However
                        there is a big difference between their cultures, which causes misunderstandings to
                        happen. The landscape is peppered in dense forest that the inhabitants hold in high
                        regard. In these forests, there are powerful What mystical happenings occur in The
                        Torwoods?

                        The swampy regions of Durglagh lie just beyond the Sea of Passwell, named after the
                        city that connects Durglagh to Eleron. Durglagh has a bloody history. Switching
                        between being a vassal of Eleron and The Torwoods, the people have had enough and
                        just recently found a shaky peace and an unstable independence. The only reason
                        their state exists is by the sanction of the Dragon's Moot, a meeting of the great
                        nations on the continent. The Lord of these lands, [to be named] is a proud son of a
                        bitch. Lots of secrets bubble underneath these bogs.
